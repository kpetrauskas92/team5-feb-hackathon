### Database Schema
Pre-project planning involved generating an entity relationship diagram. This was done in order to create a clear plan as to how all of the database models interact with each other. This was also done to determine what data fields were needed for each model. The relationship between each model and another is noted in the diagram with "FK" denoting Foreign Key. A One To One relationship exists between the User model and the UserProfile model.

### Project Deployment: Heroku

This project was deployed using Heroku and the live site can be visited [here](https://lovesched-team5-0bc1fe06d0da.herokuapp.com/). The following steps were taken to do so:

#### 1. **Initial Setup on Heroku:**

* Sign up or log in to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

* On the main Heroku Dashboard, click 'New' > 'Create New App'.
* Name your project (e.g., `lovesched-team5`). Remember, the app name must be unique.
* Choose a suitable region and then click 'Create app'.

#### 2. **Setting Up the Database:**

* Navigate to the 'Resources' tab from the submenu.

* In the 'Add-ons' section, search for 'Heroku Postgres'.
* Select and add 'Heroku Postgres' as the database.
* Go to the 'Settings' tab, and within the 'Config Vars' section, copy the `DATABASE_URL` for later use.

#### 3. **Configuring Django App for Heroku:**

* In your Django app repository, create a new file named `env.py`.
  * Import the `os` library.
  * Set the environment variable for `DATABASE_URL` (paste the address copied from Heroku).
  * Add a secret key: `os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "your_secret_key"`.

* Back in Heroku, add the secret key you just created to the 'Config Vars' (KEY: `SECRET_KEY`, VALUE: your secret key).
* Modify the `settings.py` in your Django app:
  * Import necessary libraries (`Path`, `os`, `dj_database_url`).
  * Use `if os.path.isfile("env.py"): import env`.
  * Replace the default secret key with `SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')`.
  * Update the databases section to connect to the Heroku Postgres: `DATABASES = {'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))}`.
  * Migrate models to the new database using the terminal.

#### 4. **Setting Up Cloudinary:**

* Visit [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) and either sign in or create an account.

* Copy the `CLOUDINARY_URL` from the dashboard.
* In the `env.py` file, add `os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"] = "copied_url"`.
* Add the `CLOUDINARY_URL` to the Heroku 'Config Vars'.
* Add `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` with value `1` to the 'Config Vars' (this should be removed before final deployment).
* Modify `settings.py` to configure Cloudinary:
  * Add the Cloudinary libraries to `INSTALLED_APPS` (order matters: `'cloudinary_storage'` above `'django.contrib.staticfiles'` and `'cloudinary'` below).
  * Define STATIC files settings (URL, storage path, directory path, root path, media URL, and default file storage path).

#### 5. **Final Configurations:**

* Link your templates directory in Heroku: `TEMPLATES_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')`.

* Update the templates directory to `TEMPLATES_DIR`: `'DIRS': [TEMPLATES_DIR]`.
* Add your Heroku app to `ALLOWED_HOSTS` (format: `app_name.herokuapp.com`).
* Create three top-level directories in your project: `media`, `static`, `templates`.
* Add a `Procfile` at the top level and write: `web: gunicorn PROJECT_NAME.wsgi`.
* Commit and push your changes to GitHub.

#### 6. **Deploy on Heroku:**

* In Heroku, go to the 'Deploy' tab.

* Deploy the branch manually and monitor the build logs for any issues.
* Once the build completes, you'll see a success message and a link to view the live site.

Remember to replace placeholders like `your_secret_key`, `copied_url`, and `PROJECT_NAME` with actual values relevant to your project.

### Forking the Repository
Forking the GitHub Repository allows you to have a copy of the original repository. This enables you to view or make changes without affecting the original content.

To fork the repository:

2. Navigate to the repository: [team5-feb-hackathon](https://github.com/kpetrauskas92/team5-feb-hackathon)
3. Find the 'Fork' button to create a new fork
4. When creating the fork, the name and description can be changed
5. Click 'Create fork'

### Clone a Repository
1. Go to the repository you want to clone
2. Click 'code' and copy the URL
3. Open a new workspace in your IDE
4. In a new terminal use the command '$ git clone [your-fork-repository-url]'
5. Create an Upstream branch to be able to sync with main version of the project
6. Use command '$ git remote add upstream [main-repository-url]'
7. To sync, use commands '$ git fetch upstream' and '$ git merge upstream/main'
